POE MAST
Final POE Improvements
In my final POE, I have added a few meals for users to select from within the Home Screen for my chef menu app. I also added functions in the application that calculate the average of the meal prices, a function that can add a new menu item to the list, and a function that can remove an item when added.  
Problems faced 
My application is not running, I have installed the screens and the navigation stacks, and it is still not running. There is no error in my code, when I open an integrated terminal, it runs the metro but does not run the app.
